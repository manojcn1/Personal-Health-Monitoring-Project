# 🧠 Personal Health Monitoring with Machine Learning

This project is a self-tracking, machine learning-powered system designed to analyze and predict body composition metrics like body fat % and muscle mass using smart scale data I personally collected over time.

## 📊 What It Does
- Predicts **Body Fat %** and **Muscle Mass (kg)** using historical trends
- Labels weekly progress as 🔥 Cutting, 💪 Lean Gain, 📉 Fat Gain, or ⚖️ Plateau
- Displays insights and feature importance through a custom **Streamlit dashboard**

## 🔢 Key Stats
- 🔁 100+ data points collected over 3+ months
- 🎯 Prediction MAE: **< 0.3**
- 📉 Rolling features engineered over 7-day windows
- 🧠 Models trained using Random Forest Regressor

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, joblib, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Streamlit (for interactive dashboard)
- Jupyter Notebook (for data exploration & modeling)
